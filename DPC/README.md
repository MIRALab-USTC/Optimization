   - DPC_screening contains the algorithms integrating the screening methods with solvers from SLEP;
   - SLEP contains the solver from the SLEP package (available at http://www.public.asu.edu/~jye02/Software/SLEP).    

The folder "Examples" provides the examples for the major functions implemented in this package.

If any questions about the solver, you are suggested to read the manual (available at http://www.public.asu.edu/~jye02/Software/SLEP/manual.pdf).
